# I-CeM-workshop-2022

Materials for the "Applying computational methods to census data from I-CeM" workshop run by The National Archives on 28th June 2022

## Introduction to the notebooks

A notebook is a browser based computational environment for documenting and executing steps written in a programming environment. The workshop will involve a live demonstration of three such notebooks written in the R programming language. R has been chosen for its strong data processing functionality and visualisation capability. A limited range of functionality will be used and each step will be accompanied with an explanation to aid understanding amongst participants. The workshop itself will use the Google Colab environment to host the notebooks, and participants are encouraged to open the notebooks themselves and follow along. For those who do not have Google accounts, there will also be the option to run the in the MyBinder environment. This will result in a different visual experience to running in Colabs but the general functionality (data processing and visualisation) will be the same.

## Uploading data to a notebook

The terms and conditions of I-CeM preclude us from providing sample data to use in the workshop. This means that participants who wish to follow along will need to download data from I-CeM and then upload that data to the notebook environment. The workshop will use downloads from the county of Rutland but participants are welcome to use different counties. However, we would caution against using too big a file (i.e. a large county) since the notebooks have not been tested for large amounts of data and we can not count out encountering memory issues in a limited computational environment such as Colab. The process of downloading data from I-CeM will be covered in the first section of the workshop and there will be an opportunity then to download data for the notebooks.

Note: The notebooks are intended to work with the full extract which is obtained by selecting "Download all variables (including raw textual variables)" at the Download Options stage.

To upload a file to the Colabs environment:
- click on the Files icon on the lefthand side of the notebook. This will open a pane titled "Files".
- Click on the "Upload to session storage" icon (looks like a page with an up arrow). This will open a file selection window.
- Navigate to where the files were downloaded to.
- Select one or more files (notebook 3 requires multiple files) and click the Open button
- The files will upload and their names will appear at the bottom of the pane with a rotating circle animation indicating progress.
- Wait until the animation has completely stopped and the file names have vanished before continuing the notebook to guarantee they are fully uploaded.

Colabs are a temporary environment and it may be necessary to repeat the uploading process if the environment is left unattended for a lengthy period of time.
